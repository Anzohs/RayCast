# RayCast: Basics Of RayCast With OpenGL

This repository demonstrates the basics of raycasting using OpenGL. It provides a foundational implementation for understanding raycasting techniques and how they can be applied in graphical applications.

## Features

- Implementation of raycasting with **OpenGL**.
- Written in **C++** with a **Makefile** for easy compilation.
- Provides a simple and educational introduction to raycasting concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`) that supports C++11 or later.
- **OpenGL** development libraries.
- **Make** utility.

## Building the Project

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anzohs/RayCast.git
   cd RayCast
    ```
2. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
  ```bash
   make
 ```
3. The compiled executable will be generated in the project directory.
